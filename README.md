## 📊 Workflow
1️. **Data Engineering (Excel)**
* Created Age Brackets & Credit Score Categories
* Segmented Zero Balance vs Funded Accounts
* Built interactive churn dashboard

2. **EDA (Python)**
* Identified strong churn correlation with inactivity
* Found higher churn among single-product users
* Detected geographic variation in churn behavior

3. **Modeling**
* Model	Accuracy
* Random Forest	82.5%
* XGBoost (Tuned)	86.5%

🚀 Business Recommendations

* **Re-engagement Campaigns**: Target the 1,302 "Inactive" customers with personalized digital banking incentives.
* **Product Bundling**: Create "Stickiness" by cross-selling insurance or savings products to single-account holders.
* **ZBA Intervention**: Implement automated "Low Balance" alerts and financial planning offers for Zero Balance Account holders.
